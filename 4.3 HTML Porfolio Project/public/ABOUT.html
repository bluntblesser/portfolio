<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>When I was born the earth stood still and all was silent.</p>

<p>The animal kingdom wailed to the heavens with glory upon my arrival.</p>

<p>From that day forward my journey was clear... 
  I was going to be the best Pickle Ball Player this world had ever seen, but first I have to learn to code the perfect website so the world will know of my existence.
